## Overview

The quiz app tests users by presenting true or false questions. After answering each question, the app tracks the user’s score and provides feedback. This project helped me practice building interactive React applications, using state to manage the quiz flow, and updating the score dynamically.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz**: Users can answer a series of true or false questions.
- **Score Calculation**: The app keeps track of the user’s correct answers and updates the score.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices.
- **React State Management**: The quiz logic is managed using React's `useState` hook.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Core framework for building the user interface and managing state.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles the logic behind the quiz and score tracking.
- **CSS3**: Styles the quiz interface and ensures responsive design.
- **HTML5**: Used within the JSX structure of React.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Start the development server to play the quiz locally.
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to start answering the questions.
